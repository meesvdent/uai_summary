# Lecture 9: Integrating learning and reasoning
## Content
![](chapter_9/image462.png)
Artificial intelligence is not just about probability. It is also about using logic and learning. 
This chapter will handle integration of logic and probability.


## SAT-solving
![](chapter_9/image468.png)
Sat solving, finding a model for a set of conditions, is hard.

A bayesian network can be encoded as a set of formulaâ€™s, therefore finding a model is equally hard.

![](chapter_9/image472.png)
3 kinds of problems exist in the SAT world: SAT, /#SAT and WMC. these three will be handled.


### /#SAT
How many models exist which satisfy the set of conditions / bayesian network?

## WMC
Given a prior probability of each variable having a certain value, what is the weight of each model?
![](chapter_9/image474.png)
Here elaborated for a probability of 0.5 for each boolean variable.


## Knowledge compilation
If a network can be compiled into a circuit, inference is much cheaper. This compilation is very expensive though.

Semirings are used to give meaning to nodes in the circuit.

With these semirings, the above BN is encoded and inferences can be performed much faster.

Above is an example of inference on a circuit.

More complicated semirings can be used to perform actions like max-product or gradient based inference.

Compilation of these circuits is expensive.

### Negation normal form
Circuits need to be in negation normal form for querying:
![](chapter_9/image503.png)
* Determinism: disjuncts are logically disjoint (cannot be true at the same time).
![](chapter_9/image504.png)
* Decomposable: conjuncts do not share variables

![](chapter_9/image505.png)
* Smooth: disjoints mention the same set of variables

## Problog
![](chapter_9/image521.png)
Version of prolog which can work with probabilities.

### Inference in problog
![](chapter_9/image529.png)
Steps needed: like in logic, it needs to be rewritten to ground logic.
Compiled into a circuit.
Evaluate query

Final result.
